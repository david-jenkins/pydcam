How to start the program
------------------------

Use the console scripts to make commands to start PyReadCam in different ways.

I should considere the different ways to find cameras, DCAM, Aravis, and Microgate IM.

There should be a way to start from a config file which details which interface to use, the ID (name/number) of the camera and the initial configuration.

There should be a RPyC server to control the camera, get information and update the configuration.

There should be a display to see the live view, a saver GUI to store images to disk, and a method to do live image processing.
